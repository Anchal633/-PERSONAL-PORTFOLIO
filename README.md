#ABOUT THE PROJECT 
This project is a fully responsive, single-page developer portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS, with minimal JavaScript to enhance interactivity. It is designed to serve as a digital showcase for a web developer’s skills, projects, educational background, contact details, and professional accomplishments. The project emphasizes clean structure, intuitive navigation, modern styling, and responsive behavior—making it suitable for job applications, internship showcases, or personal branding purposes.

The homepage features a fixed navigation bar with links that smoothly scroll to key sections such as About, Skills, Projects, Blog, Testimonials, and Contact. The navigation is responsive, collapsing into a hamburger-style menu on smaller devices for seamless usability. This helps users navigate effortlessly, whether they're on desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

The About section introduces the developer—in this case, “Sacha Dubois”—with a profile picture, personal introduction, educational qualifications, and professional background. A concise biography highlights Sacha’s experience, current internship, and notable achievements like awards for best student projects. There is also a button to download the résumé, and social media icons link directly to LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter, encouraging professional connection and networking.

Next, the Skills section showcases the developer’s technical stack in a responsive grid layout. Technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and Node.js are visually represented with recognizable icons and brief labels. These skill cards are interactive, featuring hover effects and subtle animations to maintain engagement.

The Projects section displays a list of completed or sample development projects. Each project is presented in a card layout with a title, brief description, and a “View Project” button. Clicking this button opens a modal popup that provides additional details about the project, enhancing user experience without redirecting to new pages. This approach keeps the layout compact and focused while still delivering full content on demand.

The Blog section is built for developers who want to showcase their writing, tutorials, or tech insights. Each blog card includes a short preview and a “Read More” button. Clicking the button expands the preview into a full-length article using a toggle animation, and allows users to hide or show the full content easily.

The Testimonials section features quotes from mentors or project leads, displayed in styled testimonial cards. This adds a layer of credibility and professional validation to the developer’s profile.

The Contact section includes a custom contact form where users can input their name, email, and message. Though this version does not use a backend server to send emails, it uses JavaScript to validate input fields and show a confirmation alert upon submission, simulating interaction and guiding user behavior.

Additionally, the project includes several thoughtful features:

A dark mode toggle, saving user preference in local storage

A scroll progress bar at the top of the page

A “Back to Top” button that appears during scrolling

Section dividers and animations to improve readability and flow

Styling is handled exclusively using custom CSS, following modern design standards. Color palettes, spacing, font hierarchy, and visual contrast have all been carefully considered for both aesthetic quality and accessibility. The layout adapts fluidly across screen sizes using flexbox and grid, aided by media queries to maintain usability on mobile and tablet devices.
